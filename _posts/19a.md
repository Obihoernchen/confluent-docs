There is an update to the HPC software stack, bringing xCAT to 2.14.5.lenovo1, based on 2.14.5,
and confluent is brought to 2.2.0.

Here are some of the highlighted changes:
# nodestorage command

Ability to create and delete volumes and arrays through the XCC

# Revamped nodediscover command behavior

Fields can now be selected and the results can be ordered by any requested
field.  New fields include switch, port, otherip, and bay.


# switches may now be added directly and indirectly

Switches previously could only be indirectly referenced to appear in the /networking apis,
now setting a node with type='switch' will cause it to be included even if it has no nodes.

Commands to generate import data for xClarity Administrator, xCAT, and ansible from confluent attributes.

# PAM enabled by default, usable alongside internal database

can be used while PAM is also enabled.  Performance is also improved with PAM authentication.
