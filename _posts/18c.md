There is an update to the HPC software stack, bringing xCAT to 2.14.3.lenovo1, based on 2.14.3,
and confluent is brought to 2.1.0.

Here are some of the highlighted changes:
# Greatly improved collective recovery behavior

# GUI now provides auto completion in the noderange field of the overview page

# nodeconfig can now provide access to advanced UEFI settings

# nodeconfig can now request restoring UEFI to factory default configuration

# nodeconfig and nodeattrib commands can now accept wildcard expressinos

# nodegroupattrib and nodeattrib can now prompt for attribute values interactively

# Discovery process can now apply relaxed password policy rules if desired

# nodeinventory has had significant improvements

# Command line tab completion for confluent commands for bash users

# Add interface for retrieving service data

See the nodesupport documentation

# Improve consistency of the /networking/macs API

The /networking/macs API would clear during a rescan.  Now it presents the previous
data until the scan completes.



# Various bug fixes
